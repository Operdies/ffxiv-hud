up-arrow button to expand frame to window
window could have tabs
tabs:
1. botanist gathering cycle with option to add or remove entry
   a. x untracks entry and moves it to separate list
   b. x in separate list removes permantently (with warning?)
   c. v in separate list restores
   d. cycle list could have x repeating entries if there aren't enough in a single day
   e. cycle could expand and shrink according to size of window
   f. '+' button to add new entries

2. button above each element to toggle hide / show in minimal view

data management:
1. implement a database instead of pickling / unpickling dictionaries
2. allow user to manage simple databases

kinks:
1. automatically expand / shrink bar width instead of truncating text
2. allow resizing of minimized version (perhaps make a slim top-bar that is draggable and has resizing hooks)
3. move mute button to maximized UI and remember mute state
4. make left-clicks pass through botanist label after topbar is implemented (maybe this is could be perceived as botting idk)
5. option to lock movement / resizing separately
6. disable focus prevention when expanded
7. program crashes when dragged outside the screen (when x or y coordinates become negative) --- fix this
8. make mute state persistent
9. more clever implementation of mute than changing "playing" flag perhaps

graphics:
1. support for adding graphics to buttons - design own graphics in photoshop
2. bitmap implementation for outlined text and transparent background
3. when highligt mode is enabled, don't use transparent background so the user doesn't place the bar over important elements

QOL:
1. support for specifying venture duration
2. support for specifying when the button should highlight / alert sound should play
3. enable changing default and highlight color
4. enable changing color of other buttons as well
5. support for adding alerts for ventures
6. first-time setup instead of using my own settings lol

Program design:
1. implement different button types as Widgets instead of just exposing tkinter elements
