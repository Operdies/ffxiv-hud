## issues:
* automatically expand / shrink bar width instead of truncating text
* allow resizing of minimized version (perhaps make a slim top-bar that is draggable and has resizing hooks)
* move mute button to maximized UI and remember mute state
* make left-clicks pass through botanist label after topbar is implemented (maybe this is could be perceived as botting idk)
* option to lock movement / resizing separately
* disable focus prevention when expanded
* program crashes when dragged outside the screen (when x or y coordinates become negative) --- fix this
* more clever implementation of mute than changing "playing" flag perhaps
* Dragging sometimes feels sluggish, especially when the game is focused
* Outlined text looks bad on some backgrounds - maybe read screen pixel and choose complementary color, or change outline logic - easiest solution would be to use a rare color like yellow I guess
* All of these issues and todos should probably be GitHub issues

## tabs:
* botanist gathering cycle with option to add or remove entry
   * x untracks entry and moves it to separate list
   * x in separate list removes permantently (with warning?)
   * v in separate list restores
   * cycle list could have x repeating entries if there aren't enough in a single day
   * cycle could expand and shrink according to size of window
   * '+' button to add new entries

* button above each element to toggle hide / show in minimal view

## data management:
* implement a database instead of pickling / unpickling dictionaries
* allow user to manage simple databases


## graphics:
* support for adding graphics to buttons - design own graphics in photoshop

## QOL / features:
* support for specifying venture duration
* support for specifying when the button should highlight / alert sound should play
* enable changing default and highlight color
* enable changing color of other buttons as well
* support for adding alerts for ventures
* first-time setup instead of using my own settings lol
* up-arrow button to expand frame to window
* support for specifying the format string on botanist bar
* quick notes
* make mute state persistent

## Program design:
* implement different button types as Widgets instead of just exposing tkinter elements
* make everything neater and less shitty
